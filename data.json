Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Black Mountain","state":"NC","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2 minutes","summary":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"summary":"small green people","city":"Buffalo","state":"Select a state","date_time":"28/5/21 21:00","shape":"Round","duration":"4 minutes","text":"The green people descended from the sky and we shot them.
